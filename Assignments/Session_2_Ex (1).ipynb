        "It's the year 2024. Recent AI applications and innovations resulted in high demand on computer chips. This made the stock prices go up for chips companies. Company FANTASTIC CHIPS's stock price was $63.48 on Jan 1st, 2024. An investor wants a program that allows them to calculate what the rate of return will be at the end of 2024 for every expected future stock price that they input to the program. The rate of return equation is:\n",

        "1. Ask the user to input their expectation of the future stock price.\n",
        "2. Calculate the rate of return.\n",
        "3. Print the rate of return as a percentage.\n",
        "4. Print True if their rate of return was positive and False if negative.\n",
